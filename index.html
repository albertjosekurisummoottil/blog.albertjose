                <h1>What is REST? - Representational State Transfer</h1>
                <p>The internet is full of code and opinions on REST and building RESTful APIs. REST stands for Representational State Transfer but what exactly does that mean and what does it mean for an API to be "RESTful"? Let's first clear up some misconceptions and look at what REST is not. Contrary to popular belief, simply using HTTP methods like GET and POST doesn't make your API RESTful. That just means that you're using HTTP. And just because an API returns JSON, doesn't make it RESTful either. There are plenty of non-REST APIs that return JSON.</p>
                <p>Finally just because your API supports CRUD operations, like creating and deleting, doesn't make it RESTful. RESTful APIs do use HTTP methods and can return JSON and can model CRUD operations but that's not specifically what makes an API RESTful. What REST is is all about modeling your API around resources and allowing clients to perform operations on those resources. In the context of REST, a resource is any object in your API's design domain. Things like documents, users, orders, reservations, and tasks.</p>
